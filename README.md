### üü¢ Overview

This Python program simulates an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system. It allows users to create a new bank account, perform various transactions like withdrawals, deposits, and check their balance. The program is interactive, prompting users for inputs and displaying relevant information accordingly.

---

### ‚≠ï Features

1. **Account Creation** : Users can create a new bank account by providing necessary details like name, email address, account type, initial deposit amount, and PIN.
2. **Transaction Handling** : Users can perform withdrawals and deposits from their accounts. The program ensures balance sufficiency for withdrawals and updates the balance accordingly for both withdrawal and deposit transactions.
3. **PIN Verification** : Users are required to enter a 4-digit PIN to access their accounts. Incorrect PIN entries prompt re-entry.
4. **Input Validation** : The program validates user inputs to ensure data integrity and user-friendly interaction.
5. **Continuity and Exit** : After each transaction, users are prompted if they want to continue using the ATM. Typing 'no' exits the program.

---

### ‚≠ï Implementation

The program is implemented using Python 3 and utilizes several concepts including object-oriented programming (OOP), input validation, and datetime manipulation. Key components of the program include:

- **ATM Class**: Defines the ATM functionalities including account creation, transaction handling, PIN verification, and user choice.
- **Helper Functions**: 
  - `account_number_generate()` : Generates a random 4-digit account number.
  - `get_email_address()` : Prompts users to enter their email address and validates its format.
- **Main Functionality Loop**: The `start()` method initiates the ATM functionalities, prompting users to create a new account and then perform transactions.

---

### ‚≠ï Usage

1. **Starting the ATM** : Run the program and input 's' to start the ATM.
2. **Account Creation** : Enter account details including name, email, account type, initial deposit, and PIN.
3. **Transactions** : Choose from withdrawal, deposit, or balance check options by entering the corresponding number.
4. **Continuity** : After each transaction, choose whether to continue or exit the ATM.

### üî¥ Conclusion

This ATM program provides a basic yet functional simulation of a real-world ATM system. It can be further extended with additional features such as account history, transfer functionalities, or improved security measures.
