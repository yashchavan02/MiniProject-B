## üü° ATM Machine Document

---

###      üü¢ Overview
This documentation provides an in-depth explanation of an ATM system implemented in Python, with a backend integration using MySQL. The system allows users to perform various banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing money, withdrawing money, changing PINs, and checking balances.

### üü£ Implementation Overview
The ATM system is designed with the following features and functionality:

#### üîµ Account Creation
- Users can create a bank account by providing their name, email, gender, account type, initial deposit amount, and PIN.
- Account details are stored in a MySQL database `bank` , specifically in the `customerdata` table.

#### üü† Transactions
- **Deposit:** Users can deposit money into their account.
- **Withdrawal:** Users can withdraw money from their account, provided they have sufficient funds.
- **Balance Inquiry:** Users can check their current account balance.

#### üü§ Security
- The system includes PIN validation when accessing the account or making changes.
- Account locking mechanism after three unsuccessful PIN attempts to prevent unauthorized access.

### üü° Uses and Functionality

#### ‚≠ï Account Creation
- Users enter their personal details such as name, email, gender, account type, and initial deposit amount.
- A unique 4-digit PIN is set during account creation.
- Upon successful creation, account details are stored in the MySQL database.

#### ‚≠ï Transactions
- **Deposit:** Users can add funds to their account, with the transaction recorded including the date and time.
- **Withdrawal:** Users can withdraw funds, with the system checking for available balance before processing.
- **Balance Inquiry:** Users can check their current balance, displayed in the system.

#### ‚≠ï PIN Management
- **Change PIN:** Users can change their PIN by entering the old PIN and setting a new 4-digit PIN.
- **Account Locking:** After three consecutive incorrect PIN attempts, the account is locked for security reasons. The user must contact support to regain access.

### üî¥ Conclusion
This ATM system provides a basic yet functional implementation of banking operations integrated with a MySQL database for data persistence. It offers essential features for managing accounts securely and performing common banking transactions. Future enhancements could include additional security measures, transaction history tracking, and multi-account support.
